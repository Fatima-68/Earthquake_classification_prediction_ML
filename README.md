**Earthquake Classification Prediction Model**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify earthquake events based on their characteristics. The model predicts different categories or types of earthquakes using a given dataset with features such as magnitude, depth, location, and more.

Project Overview
Data: The model is trained on earthquake event data, containing key geophysical attributes.

Modeling: Various machine learning techniques were explored to achieve the best classification performance.

Output: The final model predicts magnitude and the class/type of an earthquake based on input features.
